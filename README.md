# COCO-Style Dataset Doctor

Simple, work-in-progress tool to check and manipulate COCO-style datasets. 

For more complex dataset manipulation and support for different datasets, tools like [fiftyone](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone) are recommended.

cd coco-style-dataset-doctor
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Select a coco-style dataset (e.g. `coco_style_dataset.json` and corresponding image directory) and start manipulating the dataset.
